# my-test-task-for-Dev-3
It is necessary to implement moving an object behind the cursor in JS without using jQuery.

Implementation sequence:

- 2 objects must be placed on the page: input for entering text and button for applying the result

- User enters any string in input

- Clicks on the button and the entered string is displayed under the form

- The user clicks on any letter in the term and it moves after the cursor to any place

- The user presses again and the letter sets the last cursor position

- The user can move not only one letter, but scatter the entire word throughout the document

- If you release the moved character to the place of another character, then the second character becomes the previous place of the moved character. They don't overlap.

You can not use any ready-made solutions, as well as libraries for moving objects. Only pure JS and css if necessary.
